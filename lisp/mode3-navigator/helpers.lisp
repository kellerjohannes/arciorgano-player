(defmacro when-let (bindings &body body)
  "Bind `bindings` in parallel and execute `body`, short-circuiting on `nil`.

  This macro combines `when` and `let`.  It takes a list of bindings and
  binds them like `let` before executing `body`, but if any binding's value
  evaluates to `nil` the process stops and `nil` is immediately returned.

  Examples:

    (when-let ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
               (b (progn (print :b) 2))
      (list a b))
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    (1 2)

    (when-let ((a (progn (print :a) nil))
               (b (progn (print :b) 2)))
      (list a b))
    ; =>
    :A
    NIL
