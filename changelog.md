## changes for version 1.1 (1st of February 2021)

- sampler: increased polyphony management to 128 simultaneous voices
- sampler: added level value display
- sampler: added mute toggle
- sampler: bug fix, introduced 20ms fade-in and fade-out for the
  sample playback to avoid clicking noises
- sampler: bug fix, introduced 20ms ramp when changing the level
  value, to reduce distortion while changing the level
- pedal: while pedal on, notes can be 'clicked off' manually
- bug fix: removed non-functional local recording feature on the
  listener side, which caused an error message when loading the patch
- bug fix: improved reliability of the 'all notes off' module, by
  introducing a delay ('spread' in ms) between each 'key off' message
- MIDI module: default values for split velocity changed to 53

## changes for version 1.15 (4th of February 2021)

- sampler: introduced a function to avoid redundant key-on
  messages. This removes the bug that caused multiple playback of the
  same sample when connected to a MIDI keyboard while using the pedal
  function

## changes for version 1.20 (5th of February 2021)

- added feature: sine tone generator, with 16 oscillators and 6 input
  slots. Each input slot can hold a text file that defines the
  frequency, level and on/off of each oscillator.

## changes for version 1.30 (8th of February 2021)

- added feature: Sibelius bridge. This feature requires a Sibelius
  plugin that interprets a notation for Arciorgano and translates it
  into PitchBend-commands. When playing back a score within Sibelius,
  it sends out MIDI signals that can be caught by this Pd patch and
  sent to the organ (or the internal sampler) in real time.

## changes for version 1.31 (15th of February 2021)

- added samples quick load for mode 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8.

## changes for version 1.32 (17th of February 2021)

- bug fix in sampler: key number 9 was ignored by the redundancy
  module, this error is now corrected.

## changes for version 1.33 (15th of April 2021)

- added Reaper bridge: it listenes to incoming MIDI messages and
  translates them to organ messages. On channel one, the keys on the
  lower manual are numbered from 0 to 75, on channel two, the keys of
  the upper manual are numberes from 0 to 61.

## changes for version 1.34 (10th of May 2021)

- added serial communication for direct connection between computer
  (running the Pd patch) and the organ module. This is intended to be
  an alternative to OSC messages, primarily for concert situations.

## changes for version 1.40 (10th of May 2021)

- rearranged GUI, no added features, no bug fixes

## changes for version 1.41 (13th of May 2021)

- added "Velocity bridge", to read MIDI information where alterations
  are encoded in velocity values of NoteOn AND NoteOff messages.

## changes for version 1.42 (14th of May 2021)

- new feature: ear training quiz for Vicentino's intervals in mode1,
  as a subpatch in a detached window.

## changes for version 1.43 (31th of May 2021)

- added more intervals and functionality to the ear training quiz
  subpatch.

## changes for version 1.44 (20th of January 2022)

- added support for pressing the 'p'-key to trigger panic (all notes
  off).
- adapted the mapping for MIDI values to suit a piece by Anna Sowa,
  performed at Schmiedenhof Basel, June 2021.
- added the 'korobkova bridge', using a key numbering system suitable
  for 'implanted memories' by polina korobkova, performed at
  Walcheturm ZÃ¼rich, December 2021.
- added the feature 'insist' to the COM output module, triggering a
  reconnect in regular time intervals. Useful if the cable connection
  is arbitrarily established and disconnected.
- added 'algorithms' subpatch for simple generative patterns. to be
  used in the 'illuminationen v' concert at Gare du Nord (the show was
  cancelled due to Covid-19).
- added 'pozzi' algorithm, a simple 4-part ostinato in arciorgano
  tuning mode 3 ('walter pseudorein'), used on stage in the theatre
  show 'senza ora' at Gare du Nord Basel.

## changes for version 1.45 (23rd of June 2022)

- new feature: 'mode3-tonnetz'. A subpatch that works as an
  alternative keyboard, representing the pseudo-5-limit-Tonnetz of
  Mode3. The trigger fields are connected to the keyboard and pipe
  layout in the main patch, they are mutually synchronized.
- new feature: 'incudine bridge'. This module receives OSC messages
  and interprets them as key/pipe on/off information. It was added
  establish a connection between 'incudine' (a Common Lisp live coding
  package) and the Pd patch.
- added 'mode3-navigator': this is a rough sketch of a Tonnetz
  navigation system written in Common Lisp using 'incudine'.
- added 'elysium' code: a simple counterpoint generator for mode1
  written in Common Lisp, using 'incudine'. This was used on stage for
  the theater play "Tochter aus Elysium", produced by Neues Theater
  Dornach, spring 2022.

## changes for version 1.50 (28th of August 2022)

- new feature: 'dreyblatt-square'. A subpatch with an alternative
  playing interface according to Arnold Dreyblatt's 'magic
  square'. The interface is a rearrangement of the keyboard interface,
  similar to 'mode3-tonnetz'. It requires mode3 to work.
- feature in development: 'dreyblatt bridge'. Another MIDI mapping to
  be used with Ableton Live, set up by Arnold Dreyblatt. It uses a
  subset of the organ keys (only MIDI channel 1).
